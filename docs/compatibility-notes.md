# Compatibility notes

## Foundry image tag

`ghcr.io/foundry-rs/foundry:v1.7.1` exists and was pulled successfully
(digest `sha256:8347b728d5d393dac1c018691b36f506d23b9dcd78341d40ea0fcb11c3a19cdd`).
`infra/anvil/Dockerfile` uses that tag directly; no fallback to `:latest`
was needed.

## Agora Next Prisma web2/web3 split

`vendor/agora-next/src/app/lib/prisma.ts` exports `prismaWeb2Client` and
`prismaWeb3Client`, but both names are bound to the same `PrismaClient`
instance, built from a single `DATABASE_URL`:

```ts
const prismaWeb2Client = prismaClient;
const prismaWeb3Client = prismaClient;
```

`prisma/schema.prisma` also declares only one `datasource db` block with one
`schemas = [...]` list covering every tenant schema (`agora`, `config`,
`b3`, and the rest). There is no actual database split today; the two
exported names look like preparation for a future split that has not
happened.

Per the plan's fallback rule for this case, `infra/postgres/gen-stub.ts`
puts everything (the `fleet`-mapped `b3` views, plus the shared `agora` and
`config` tables) into `agora_web3`, and also writes the same `agora`/
`config` stub tables into `agora_web2` (`infra/postgres/init/03-agora-web2-stub.sql`),
so either connection string renders empty reads instead of failing on a
missing table.

## Postgres host port is 55432, not 5432

This machine (and any dev machine that already runs a local Postgres) may
have something bound to `127.0.0.1:5432`/`[::1]:5432` already: on this host
that's a Homebrew-managed `postgresql@16` service. To let this stack run
alongside that without touching it, `infra/docker-compose.yml` publishes the
`postgres` service's container port 5432 on host port `${POSTGRES_PORT:-55432}`
instead of 5432. The container's own Postgres still listens on 5432
internally (that's what `01-roles.sql`/`02-agora-stub.sql`/
`03-agora-web2-stub.sql` run against); only the host-side mapping moved.

Connect from the host with:

```
psql postgres://agora:agora@localhost:55432/agora_web3 -c '\dt fleet.*'
```

No need to stop a local Postgres service to verify this stack; a host
service already on 5432 is untouched and keeps running throughout.
